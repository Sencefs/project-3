# Project 03: Fit and Track

## Description

Fit and Track is a one stop shop to track all things nutrition and fitness. An application that allows you to follow workouts, track your food/water intake, and makes it easier to stay committed to a meal plan and workout schedule.
With all the stress from the ongoing pandemic and various world events, a lot of us have noticed a substantial amount of weight gained. According to Dr. Elizabeth Pegg Frates of Harvard Health Publishing, “39% of patients gained weight during the pandemic, with weight gain defined as above the normal fluctuation of 2.5 pounds.” 
We might try to lose weight by eating the occasional healthy meal and trying some sketchy over the counter medication, but the truth is that you need consistency and discipline to stick with a routine long enough to reap those rewards. That’s where technology can help. The right app can act as a virtual personal trainer or training partner to keep you ardent and accountable. That is why all of us at Group 4 decided to construct Fit and Track, an enthralling and exhilarating app that allows you to stay on track with YOUR fitness goals.
